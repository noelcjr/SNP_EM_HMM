Machine Learning for automated single nucleotide polimorphism array
This software have a few bugs and works under careful selection of 
some of its parameters.

Known Bugs:
* Selection of best model using vitervi's algorithm is faulty. It works most of the time but fails in some instances.

Possible Enhancements:
* Make adjustable parameter selection automatically.
* Automatically select the amount of data to be processed so that normal distributions fit the data better.
